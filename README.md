# **GitHub Scraper**

## **Description**
The **GitHub Scraper** is a versatile tool designed to search and analyze repositories on GitHub based on customizable criteria. Whether you're looking for repositories written in specific programming languages, using certain tools or technologies, or updated within a specific timeframe, this scraper has got you covered. It supports both **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** and **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** modes.

---

## **Requirements**
To use the GitHub Scraper, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**: The scraper is built using Python and requires version 3.7 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
  - `requests`
  - `colorama`
  - `retrying`
  - `tqdm`
  - `pandas`
  - `tkinter` (for GUI)
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: A valid GitHub token is required to authenticate API requests and avoid rate limits. See the [Token Creation](#token-creation) section below for instructions.

---

## **Features**
- **Customizable Search**: Filter repositories by programming language, tools/technologies, star ratings, and date ranges.
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Automatically manages GitHub API rate limits to ensure uninterrupted scraping.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements retry logic for failed API requests, ensuring robustness.
- **CLI and GUI Interfaces**: Offers both command-line and graphical interfaces for flexibility.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Fetches repository metadata, including the latest commit date, owner details, and more.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays real-time progress during the scraping process.
- **Clickable Links**: In the GUI mode, repository URLs are clickable for quick access.

---

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-scraper.git
   cd github-scraper
   ```
2. **Set Up Your GitHub Token**:
   - Create a personal access token as described in the [Token Creation](#token-creation) section.
   - Replace the placeholder `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE` in the script with your token.
3. **Run the Scraper**:
   - For CLI mode:
     ```bash
     python github_scraper_cli.py
     ```
   - For GUI mode:
     ```bash
     python github_scraper_gui.py
     ```

## **Usage**
### **CLI Mode**
1. Run the CLI script:
   ```bash
   python github_scraper_cli.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to select a programming language, filter by tools/technologies, specify star ranges, and set date filters.
3. View the results directly in the terminal.

### **GUI Mode**
1. Run the GUI script:
   ```bash
   python github_scraper_gui.py
   ```
2. Use the dropdown menus and checkboxes to configure your search criteria:
   - Select programming languages.
   - Filter by tools/technologies.
   - Set star ranges and date filters.
3. Click the "Search Repositories" button to start the scraping process.
4. View the results in the log area, with clickable links to the repositories.

## **Token Creation**
To use the GitHub Scraper, you need to generate a **Personal Access Token**:
1. Go to your **GitHub Account Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Developer Settings** → **Personal Access Tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**.
3. Click **Generate New Token** and select **Generate New Token (classic)**.
4. Select the necessary scopes:
   - `repo`: Full control of private repositories.
   - `read:org`: Read organization membership.
5. Copy the generated token and paste it into the script where indicated (`YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE`).

> **Note**: Keep your token secure and do not share it publicly. If your token is compromised, revoke it immediately from your GitHub account settings.

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Advanced Filters**: Add support for filtering by license type, repository size, or contributor count.
- **Export Options**: Allow users to export results in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel).
- **Parallel Processing**: Implement multi-threading to speed up large-scale queries.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based dashboard for remote access and collaboration.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models to recommend repositories based on user preferences.

---

## **Tips and Tricks**
- **Optimize Queries**: Use specific keywords and filters to narrow down results and reduce API calls.
- **Monitor Rate Limits**: Regularly check your rate limit status to avoid unexpected interruptions.
- **Use Tokens Wisely**: Authenticate with a personal access token to increase your rate limit allowance.
- **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, consider breaking queries into smaller batches to stay within rate limits.

---

## **Ethical Considerations**
- **Respect Rate Limits**: Always adhere to GitHub's API usage policies to avoid overloading their servers.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that scraped data is used responsibly and does not violate any privacy agreements.
- **Attribution**: Properly credit repository owners when using their data for research or analysis.
